The MagneTag Hub is the software that powers the MagneTag system.

## Controllers Overview

A controller is a view for working with a specific part of the MagneTag Hub or for working in a specific way.

There are four main controller types, each with a different purpose. These are:
* **[Self-Service (Kiosk) Controller](self-service-controller)**: The self-service controller lets games run without a staff attendant. It's designed to work with a touch screen, allowing customers to start their own games.
* **Full-Service (FEC) Controller**: The full-service controller is designed for use in a staffed environment. The staffer uses the controller to operate games.
* **Tournament Controller**: The tournament controller manages tournaments. It creates a seeded single-elimination bracket, keeps track of players, and manages game play.
* **Admin Controller**: The admin controller is for administering the system. This includes configuring the Hub, configuring armor vests and other devices, managing users, and basic troubleshooting.

## Devices and Controllers

Each armor vest (and any other devices used for game play) must be assigned to a specific controller or controllers. This allows a single MagneTag Hub to run multiple game stations. For instance, there may be two separate full-service controllers, each with four armor vests assigned to them. This would allow two different sets of games to be operated simultaneously, with each one having up to four players.

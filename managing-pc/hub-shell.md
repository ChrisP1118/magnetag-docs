## Hub Shell

When turned on, the MagneTag PC automatically runs an application called the "MagneTag Hub Shell". This is essentially an embedded web browser that's set to run a specific controller.

On self-service systems, the Hub Shell runs a self-service (kiosk) controller; on full-service systems, the Hub shell runs a full-service (FEC) controller.

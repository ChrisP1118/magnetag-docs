Welcome to MagneTag! We know you're anxious to play your first game -- this guide will help you get up and running as quickly as possible.

# Identifying Your MagneTag System

Before getting started, take a minute to [get to know your MagneTag system](know-your-system.md). This will help you ensure you've got all the hardware you need. It'll also help you identify your system -- this will make the rest of the documentation here a lot easier to understand.

# Turn it on
To get started, plug everything in and turn it on.

Insert the batteries into the armor vests. Power banks need to be turned on first; there is a small button near the charging port.

It might take a few minutes for everything to turn on. Once it's all on, your armor vests should light up. The screen on the PC should show a video of people playing MagneTag.

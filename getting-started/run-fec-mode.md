MagneTag's FEC mode is designed to be full-service. This means it works best when there's a dedicated person staffing the game,
adjusting the game is necessary. There are a lot more game play options in full-service mode than self-service (kiosk) mode.

# Players and Teams

In full-service mode, each player corresponds to a specific vest. We recommend adding labels to the physical vests that match the 
names displayed on screen for each vest -- this makes it a lot easier to get players organized into teams.

Players are organized into teams. Each team has a color, and each player on the team has a name. These names correspond to the armor
vests being used and aren't meant to be personalized with the real names of players.

There's a panel on the right side of the screen that displays match options, including buttons for adding and removing teams. The team
colors are always in the same order -- the first team is always red, the second team is always blue, etc.

The players on the team appear below the name of the team. There's also a list of "Unallocated Players". These are armor vests that
aren't currently in use for the upcoming match.

There are two ways to move a player between teams:
* Touch/click the name or icon for a player. They'll automatically move to the next team.
* Click the "Start Tag In" button. While in tag-in mode, hitting their armor vest with their sword will automatically move the player to
the next team. This can make it easier for players to choose their own teams.

There's also a "Clear All" that will remove all players from each team.

If a vest disconnects (for instance, if the battery dies or it goes out of range of the system), it'll automatically be moved to the list
of unallocated players.

# Match Settings

The panel on the right shows the different settings for the upcoming match. Some of these settings vary depending on the type of match.

## Match Type

There are currently two types of matches:
* **Combat** is the classic MagneTag game. Each team starts with a certain amount of health and loses health each time they're hit. The
last team with remaining health wins. This type of game can accommodate a wide range of players in any team configuration.
* **Time Tag** is an intense, countdown-based game. Each team starts with a certain amount of time on the clock. When they're hit,
their clock starts running down. When they hit their opponent, their clock stops running and their opponent's clock starts counting
down.

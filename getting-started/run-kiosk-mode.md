MagneTag's kiosk mode is designed to be self-service. It's easy enough that your customers can use the system on their own without staffing.

# Splash Screen

Initially, the system shows the splash screen, showing videos of people playing the game. Users can touch the screen to continue.

# Options Screen

If you have more than two vests, the Options screen is displayed, letting the user choose how many players they want.

# Ready Screen

Next, the players should put on their armor vests. Once each team is ready, they should touch the button on the screen that says their team is ready.

# Game

After a short countdown, the game begins.

# Return Armor Vests Screen

After the game has finished, players are instructed to return their armor vests and press a button once they're done. Once they press that button, the system returns to the Splash screen.
